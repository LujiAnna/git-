0. This file started in remote with name git_
Was cloned as such in folder HYF, hence it has the name git_
1. Renamed remote repo from git- to git_rename_github 
also new file was created in local repo

a. How to incorporate that new name from local repo
b. and incorporate local changes back to remote

Try...


push changes from this git_ back to master 
ls 
> shows the new file text-- the one am writing all this in
$ git status
> shows red text as untracked file
> !!! git add file: use this to track
// oops...before tracking, I changed again this text file by writing this 
line, just save, no need to commit as fike is still untracked yet (no git add, just quick check with git status.. which still shows the red text file as untracked) . now do the add (track your changes in file)
$ git add text
> check status
$ git status
> on branch master: this text file is tracked in branch master
> no commits yet : commit and msg is not done yet
> !!! can use git rm --cashed : to unstage the tracking
> the file is green. indicating that its being tracked
// oops again...after tracking...i modified this text file but writing this
how does the file react in git? (use git status)i need to save. but do i need to retrack? 
what if i go ahead and commit as is? are the new changes incorporated 
$ git status
> shows that changes are not staged. 
> !!! git add file: is suggested to update what will be commited
> !!! git restore file: to discard chnges in the working directory 
> !!! git -A, --all: add changes from all tracked and untracked files
> HINT: always add then commit your changes
> at this point, nothing shows on github
$ git commit -m 'first commit of text' *************************shows on github
> successfully commited. but only in my local repo. 
> check remote repo shows no activity
> i need to update the remote (origin) with local (master) (which has a different name now)
$ git push origin master
>remote: This repository moved. Please use the new location:
remote:   https://github.com/LujiAnna/git_rename_github.git
> check remote repo : nothing shows
> i need to rename this repo now
> $ mv <source_directory> <target_directory>
> linux said no such file/directory
> try to hard rename
$ git status
> wants to stage change for commit
> branch is uptodate with origin/master
$ git commit -am 'second commit..'  *************************shows on github
>successfully
$ git status
> on branch master
> branch is ahaed of o/m by 1 commit 
> git push: to publish your local commits
$ git push origin master
> still saying thie repo moved, use new location.
FREESTYLE 
> thinking of ...reclone? or pull
> lets try to do a PR
> nope . stop. redo everything from the beginning and reclone the new repo
> OR rename local back to how it was previous : git-
> then, rename the remote repo back as well to git-
$ git status
$ git commit - am 'back to original'  ????????????- not showing on github 
> push wasnt done yet
$ git status
