0. This file started in remote with name git_
Was cloned as such in folder HYF, hence it has the name git_
1. Renamed remote repo from git- to git_rename_github 
also new file was created in local repo

a. How to incorporate that new name from local repo
b. and incorporate local changes back to remote

Try...


push changes from this git_ back to master 
ls 
> shows the new file text-- the one am writing all this in
$ git status
> shows red text as untracked file
> !!! git add file: use this to track
// oops...before tracking, I changed again this text file by writing this 
line, just save, no need to commit as fike is still untracked yet (no git add, just quick check with git status.. which still shows the red text file as untracked) . now do the add (track your changes in file)
$ git add text
> check status
$ git status
> on branch master: this text file is tracked in branch master
> no commits yet : commit and msg is not done yet
> !!! can use git rm --cashed : to unstage the tracking
> the file is green. indicating that its being tracked
// oops again...after tracking...i modified this text file but writing this
how does the file react in git? (use git status)i need to save. but do i need to retrack? 
what if i go ahead and commit as is? are the new changes incorporated 
$ git status
> shows that changes are not staged. 
> !!! git add file: is suggested to update what will be commited
> !!! git restore file: to discard chnges in the working directory 
> !!! git -A, --all: add changes from all tracked and untracked files
> HINT: always add then commit your changes
> at this point, nothing shows on github
$ git commit -m 'first commit of text' *************************shows on github
> successfully commited. but only in my local repo. 
> check remote repo shows no activity
> i need to update the remote (origin) with local (master) (which has a different name now)
$ git push origin master
>remote: This repository moved. Please use the new location:
remote:   https://github.com/LujiAnna/git_rename_github.git
> check remote repo : nothing shows
> i need to rename this repo now
> $ mv <source_directory> <target_directory>
> linux said no such file/directory
> try to hard rename
$ git status
> wants to stage change for commit
> branch is uptodate with origin/master
$ git commit -am 'second commit..'  *************************shows on github
>successfully
$ git status
> on branch master
> branch is ahaed of o/m by 1 commit 
> git push: to publish your local commits
$ git push origin master  **************MUST DO THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!

$ git status
$ git commit - am 'back to original'  ****?????- not showing on github. showed after push

$ git status
$ git commit - am 'typo on prior...' *****?? not showing on github. showed after push
> git status
> just do add, commit then push immediately
> chech github > still first and second commit
> question, what if you commit before adding
$ git commit -m 'commit bofere adding' ??????DIDNT SHOW UP ON GITHUB, coz u didnt ADD!!!
>on branch master
> master is ahead of o/m by 2 commits
> lets go ahead and push ..remember we didnt add sth before 'commit b4 adding'
$ git push origin master  **************MUST DO THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!
> check in github
$ git commit -am 'fifth commit before push'

> Question: if i change repos name locally, and needs to perform push, what happens
> quesstion next : what happens if i change name of file in a repo (case 1 locally, case to remote)

IMPORTANT: from what we have practised above, it is important to add and commit 
you dont have to push, as all commits will show up either way in any PUSH you do further down the line 

back to creating branch and push directly!

$ git status
still reds 
$ git branch
master and file 
$ git checkout -b feature1 master
> M   text ...what does this even mean ????
> Switched to a new branch 'feature1'
# maybe add particular file 
$ git add file 
# maybe commit changes as well
$ git commit -m 'first command in first feature'
# remember nothing shows in the github as nothing is pushed yet 
# imncorporating a finished feature1 on master, switch branch to master 
$ git checkout master
# check which branch you had 
$ git branch 
# you should be on master
# first add and commmit all the new changes in files at master 
which ones are they?
$ git status 
> notice file file is no longer red, only text (this one ), and other files readme 
$ git add text 
# check to see how it all is 
$ git status
> after tracking/add text, text file is green now  
# add  changes / commit  
$ git commit -m 'added stuff in text before after branching off and back '
# about to push feature1 branch ...


after adding the touched text file thru master and while in master...
!!!do MERGE of feature1 to master, so u can push the master back to origin 
and NOT the feature as is back to origin as in homework2 dev-strategy 

# first check which branches names are there especially one u want to merge 
$ git branch 
# choose branch you want to merge back to master 
$ git merge feature1 

# see how to deal with merge msg

# next time try to use --no -ff for no fastforward to create a new commit 
 even if merge could be performed with fast-forward 

$ git branch 
$ git status

!!!!!!# time to push the master whihc merged with feature1 branch back to remote 
# REMEMBER you are pushing MERGED MASTER TO ORIGIN !!!VERY IMPORTANT ***

# you should no commits yet, until you have accepted the Pull (which is push really) request on the particular repo
!!!!! # so check your github repo 
!!!! # didnt work, must be the weird merge msg 
try using --no -f for no fast forward when merging
then check git branch and git status
$ git branch
> all branches present, feature1, master and another one 
$ git status 
> red text file and others, but green file file
# now while in master, do the branch merge again to master 
$ git merge --no-f feature1  (no space in btn)
> says already uptodate
$ git push origin master 


NOW: try to replicate again what you have done
1. create branch off master: call it feature2 
$ git checkout -b feature2 master 
2. make sure you have checked out 
$ git branch
3. do anything with anything whatever
$ touch file2 or add some changes to say file and save
4. save, add and commited 
$ git add file(1)
$ git commit -m 'another tweak'
5. checkout to master 
$ git checkout master
6. make sure you are in master branch
$ git branch 
- you might need to add some changes from the other file running with master
$ git status
7. choose file to add in master
$ git add particularfile
$ git commit -m 'identify msg'
8. MERGE feature2 with master with no fastforward option // what if you do not merge?
$ git merge --no-f feature2
9. PUSH back to remote
$ git push origin master
$ git push origin feature2

10. observe your merged branch if has been pushed back to master from github-insight-network 

write commands of the above.
see that you dont miss any step 
if error, write why and write in capital what you missed and command you missed
try to do this off your memory 

GOOD JOB.
EVERYTHING WORKS FINE!!

small problem: I have only one branch on github
I created 2 new branches using the command line, and when I use the command 'git branch' I can see all of my branches in the window, but when I used the command 'git push' I get a message that says, "nothing to commit, working directory clean' and so I'm not seeing my new branches on github.com.
There is appearance of branches trees in network BUT not in branches-lists ..all comments are there nevertheless

!!!! so add another STEP 9 to push origin feature 

#swith back to feature3 
$ git checkout feature3 
$ git push origin feature3
#feature3 is not merged, hence it appears in network but and in github commit 
#try pushing feature2 while at master 
 $ git push origin feature2
> create a pull request on github to merge feature3 as it was not merged 



 
====================BRANCHING OFF MASTER: github/git-flow==================
- feature branch
- hw 2 : dev strategies
description : commit to master separate branches, (or push branch to master)
then push that particular *branch to github /origin. then iterate (git push origin feature) 
Try: 
  option1 : return to master and add /commit in master : doesnt make sense 
  opt2: return to master and do git push master feature : start with this ..not possible 
  $ git push master feature4  ?????? didnt work out 
  > ....some msg i forgot to write (it was too late and was sleepy)
  
  Option2:
  # go back to branch, and push it from there w/o consulting the master 
  $ git checkout feature4
  > compare and Pull request shows button which reads Can’t automatically merge.
  maybe could have make a PR ?

Option 3:
just branch off from origin 
# I forgot to checkout to master, as I was in feature4 
$ git branch feature 5
> this branch will be out of feature4, so discard it 
$ git checkout master
$ git branch feature6
$ git checkout feature6 
or could have done $ git checkout -b feature6 

then 2 subptions:
-then push feature6 from feature6 to origin  
$ git push origin feature6 
> go to github: compare & pull request 
> couldnt automatically merge, so had to create PR 
> it has some conflicts 
> choose option: resolve conflicts 
> its funny coz everything from file for feature6 had to be deleted for merge to be happening
> also feature 6 is still hanging and not back to master 
- push feature7 from feature 7 to origin
try this  
- push master from master to origin 

descr: 
- do same for branch 2, 3 , ...etc
