# trying exercise 2 : dev strategy

pushing directly to master

each branch/feature should push directly to master /origin

$ git checkout -b feature1 master

$ git checkout -b feature2 master

performing with no- merge . skipp step no.8

but add 

git push origin feature3

github asked to merge feature3, even when pushed feature2 branch with

git push origin feature2
