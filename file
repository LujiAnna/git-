# trying exercise 2 : dev strategy

pushing directly to master

each branch/feature should push directly to master /origin

$ git checkout -b feature1 master

$ git checkout -b feature2 master

performing with no- merge . skip step no.8
this had to be merged in github by making a PR request, merge etc 

Now trying to commit on branch off origin , (not from master as before.)
$ git checkout -b feature6
